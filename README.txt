Least-Squares Regression
Alan Yang & Vikram Anjur

Performs Least-Squares Linear Regression, fitting a line to a text file of data points, with the smallest chi squared
value. Uses a matrix projection approach. Outputs and equation, a chi squared value, and a graph of the curve (in 2D, default xy plane)

Input text file format:

1. equation format
2. list of variables
3. desired x,y,z, etc. values spaced by tabs.

Example:
y=Ax+B
x,y
2.3	4
5	2.2
7.3	9.4
